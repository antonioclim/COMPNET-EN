# Lecture presentations (optional HTML exports)

## Status

The 14 weekly lecture presentations in this folder are HTML exports. They were produced through an automated translation/export pipeline and are provided **as optional material**.

- The canonical, fully maintained lecture content is in `03_LECTURES/` (Markdown + figures + scenarios).
- The HTML exports have received **targeted clean-ups** (structural fixes and removal of obvious Romanian fragments), but they still require **human proofreading** before being used as primary teaching artefacts.

For an evidence-based list of remaining mixed-language markers, see `LANGUAGE_AUDIT_FINAL.md` in the repository root.

## Recommendation

If you intend to deliver directly from slides, consider regenerating the HTML from an English source (for example Markdown + Reveal.js/Marp/Quarto) rather than iteratively patching the exported HTML.
