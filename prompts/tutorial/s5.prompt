it's fine we'll continue to Seminar 5 - Adresare şi rutare. Subnetting IPv.4IIPv6, introducere simulator de reţea. Configurarea unei infrastructuri de reţea

Again the tutorial is 80 minutes. We have the following things to cover:
- ip addressing and subnetting, maybe using an online calculator
- we need a simulation environment. i've used mininet and can give you some examples with that. one alternative is to use docker compose instead. i'm open to suggestions on your side as well

what would be an appropriate outline?
