title Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz: channels and overlap (concept)

rectangle "Channel 1\n2412 MHz" as c1
rectangle "Channel 6\n2437 MHz" as c6
rectangle "Channel 11\n2462 MHz" as c11

c1 --> c6 : gap ~25 MHz
c6 --> c11 : gap ~25 MHz

note bottom
  In practice, the 1/6/11 combination minimises overlap
  (in many regions).
