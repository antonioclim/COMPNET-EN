title Switch: CAM table learning (concept)

[Host A\nMAC_A] as A
[Host B\nMAC_B] as B
[Host C\nMAC_C] as C
[Switch] as SW

A -- SW
B -- SW
C -- SW

note right of SW
  1) When a frame arrives
     learns: source MAC -> port
  2) If destination MAC is known:
     forwards only on that port
  3) If unknown:
     floods on all other ports
