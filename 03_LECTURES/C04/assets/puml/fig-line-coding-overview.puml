rectangle "Bits:\n1 0 0 1 1 0" as bits

rectangle "NRZ\n- constant level for the bit duration\n- sensitive to synchronisation" as nrz
rectangle "NRZI\n- transition for 1 (or 0)\n- more robust for long sequences" as nrzi
rectangle "Manchester\n- transition at mid-bit\n- self-synchronising\n- higher bandwidth" as man
