title RIP: loop and count-to-infinity (concept)

[Router R1] as R1
[Router R2] as R2
[Router R3] as R3
[Network Z] as Z

R1 -- R2
R2 -- R3
R3 -- R1
R1 -- Z

note right of R2
  If the R1-Z link fails,
  R2 may falsely "learn" from R3
  that Z is reachable via R1,
  and the metric grows steadily (up to 16).
end note

note bottom
  RIP mitigations:
  split horizon, route poisoning, holddown, timeout.
