title Distance-vector: concept (RIP)

[Router A] as A
[Router B] as B
[Router C] as C
[Destination\nNetwork X] as X

A -- B
B -- C
C -- X

note right of A
  A knows:
  - distance to X
  - next hop: B
  It does not know the full topology.
end note

note right of B
  Routers periodically exchange
  their distance vectors (tables).
end note
