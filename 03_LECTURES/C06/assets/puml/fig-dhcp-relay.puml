title DHCP Relay (server in another network)

package "Client LAN" {
  [Client] as C
  [Router (Relay)] as R
  C --> R
}

package "Server network" {
  [DHCP Server] as S
}

R --> S : forward DHCP (unicast)\nwith relay info
S --> R : Offer/Ack
R --> C : broadcast/unicast local

note right of R
  Broadcasts do not cross routers.
  The relay mediates the request.
