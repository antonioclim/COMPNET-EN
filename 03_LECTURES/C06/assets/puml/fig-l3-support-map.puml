rectangle "IP\n(IPv4 / IPv6)\npacket transport" as IP

rectangle "ARP\n(IPv4)\nIP -> MAC" as ARP
rectangle "NDP\n(IPv6)\nNS/NA, RS/RA" as NDP
rectangle "ICMP\n(IPv4)\nerrors + diagnostics" as ICMP
rectangle "ICMPv6\n(errors + NDP)" as ICMP6
rectangle "DHCP\n(IPv4)\nconfiguration allocation" as DHCP
rectangle "DHCPv6\n(IPv6)\nsupplementary config" as DHCP6
rectangle "NAT / PAT\n(IPv4 transition)" as NAT

ARP --> IP
NDP --> IP
ICMP --> IP
ICMP6 --> IP
DHCP --> IP
DHCP6 --> IP
NAT --> IP

note bottom of IP
  IP delivers packets between networks.
  The rest are support protocols: configuration, resolution, errors.
