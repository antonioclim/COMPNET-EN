### Tasks — Python HTTP Server (http.server)

#### 1. Start the server

Run:

```

python3 simple_http_builtin.py 8000

```

Then test with:

```

curl -v [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
curl -v [http://localhost:8000/hello](http://localhost:8000/hello)
curl -v [http://localhost:8000/api/time](http://localhost:8000/api/time)

```

Save the results in a file:

```

builtin_http_log.txt

```

---

#### 2. Add a new endpoint

In the file **simple_http_builtin.py**, modify the `MyHandler` class so
that a new endpoint exists:

```

/student

````

which returns JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "<your name>",
  "lab": 8
}
````

---

#### 3. Test the new endpoint

Use:

```
curl -v http://localhost:8000/student
```

Append the result to `builtin_http_log.txt`.

---

#### 4. Observe the headers

In the same file, answer the following questions (2–3 sentences each):

1. What header does `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` automatically generate for static files?
2. What differences exist between the headers generated by `/hello` and those generated by `/api/time`?
3. Why is it important to send `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` correctly?

---

After this stage, you are ready for **implementing a manual HTTP server with sockets**, where we will build HTTP responses from scratch.
