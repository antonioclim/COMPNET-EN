#### Tasks – Stage 1: Starting the Infrastructure and Basic Verification

Create the file:
`stage1_pentest_setup_log.txt`

Complete the steps below.

---

### 1. Starting the infrastructure

In the directory containing `S13_Part02_Config_Docker_Compose_Pentest.yml`:

```bash
docker compose -f S13_Part02_Config_Docker_Compose_Pentest.yml up -d
```

Verify the containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

In `stage1_pentest_setup_log.txt`, record:

* the `docker compose` command used
* the `docker ps` output (at least the lines for dvwa, webgoat and vsftpd_vuln)

---

### 2. Verify HTTP access (DVWA + WebGoat)

Quick test with a browser or curl:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8888/
curl -I http://localhost:8080/
```

In the log file:

* paste the status lines (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)
* note the `Server` header if present

---

### 3. Verify FTP access (vulnerable vsftpd)

Minimal test:

```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 2121
```

You should see a banner such as:

```
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
```

Copy the banner into `stage1_pentest_setup_log.txt`.

### 4. Short questions

At the end of the file, answer in a few sentences:

1. Why is it important to conduct labs of this kind in an isolated environment (Docker / VM)?
2. What services and ports have you identified so far (through manual tests only, without nmap)?
