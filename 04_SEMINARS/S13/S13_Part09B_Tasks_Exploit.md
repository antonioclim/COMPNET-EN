#### Tasks – Stage 5: Implementing the Exploit in Python

Create the file:
`stage5_exploit_results.txt`

---

## 1. Complete the STUDENT CODE sections in `S13_Part09_Script_FTP_Backdoor_Exploit.py`

* Implement the connection to the FTP service
* Implement the connection to the backdoor
* Ensure the script sends the `id` command

---

## 2. Run the script

```bash
python3 S13_Part09_Script_FTP_Backdoor_Exploit.py
```

In `stage5_exploit_results.txt`, copy:

* the FTP banner
* the messages printed by the script
* the response received from the backdoor (e.g. the output of the `id` command)

---

## 3. Theoretical questions

Write 5–10 lines on each of the following:

### a) Why is it dangerous to expose old services (FTP, SSH, web, etc.)?

### b) Why can a simple exploit completely compromise a system?

### c) What countermeasures exist:

* update / patching
* firewall
* WAF
* IDS / IPS
* periodic auditing
