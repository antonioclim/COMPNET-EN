#### Seminar 13 – Stage 1

## Introduction: Penetration Testing in a Controlled Environment + Lab Infrastructure

### 1. Seminar Objective

The seminar is a hands-on exercise within a **controlled environment** containing:

* vulnerable web applications
* a vulnerable FTP server
* a small network that we scan and attack

We follow the classic penetration-testing workflow:

1. Reconnaissance / **initial investigation**
2. **Port scanning** and service identification
3. **Vulnerability identification**
4. **Controlled exploitation** of selected simple vulnerabilities

All activities take place on a local Docker infrastructure — NOT on the internet and NOT on real systems belonging to other organisations.

---

### 2. Legal and Ethical Warning

It is **strictly forbidden** to run the techniques and tools from this lab:

* on the university network (outside this environment)
* on networks or servers you do not own
* on internet-facing systems without explicit consent

The purpose of this lab is to:

* understand how attackers think
* learn to recognise and prevent vulnerabilities

Not to become a "black-hat".

---

### 3. Lab Infrastructure (overview)

We use a file `S13_Part02_Config_Docker_Compose_Pentest.yml` that starts:

1. **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web App)

   * a vulnerable PHP web application (SQLi, XSS, brute force, etc.)
   * exposed on port `8888`

2. **WebGoat**

   * an OWASP Java web application with pedagogical vulnerabilities
   * exposed on port `8080`

3. **vsftpd 2.3.4 (vulnerable)**

   * an FTP server with a notorious backdoor
   * exposed on port `2121`

All services share the same Docker network:

* subnet: `172.20.0.0/24`
* addresses:

  * DVWA: `172.20.0.10`
  * WebGoat: `172.20.0.11`
  * vsftpd: `172.20.0.12`

---

### 4. Tools Used

On the host machine (or in a separate "kali" container) you will use:

* `nmap` – port scanning, service detection
* `curl` – quick HTTP testing
* `nc` (`netcat`) – raw TCP/UDP connections
* optionally:

  * `nikto` – web vulnerability scanning
  * `wireshark` or `tcpdump` – traffic analysis (optional)

Later in this seminar:

* we write:

  * a simple port scanner in Python
  * a small exploit script for the FTP backdoor

---

### 5. What We Do in Stage 1

Stage 1 covers the following:

* start the Docker infrastructure
* verify that the services are running
* connect to each service (HTTP/FTP) to confirm everything works
* prepare the ground for the scanning stage (nmap + Python scanner)

---

### 6. What Comes Next

In Stage 2:

* we use `nmap` to scan the 172.20.0.0/24 network
* we write a small script `S13_Part04_Script_Simple_Scanner.py` that checks open ports on a single IP address
* we document the ports and services discovered

Note:

* The images `vulnerables/web-dvwa`, `webgoat/webgoat-8.0`, `vulnerables/vsftpd:2.3.4` are widely used in labs; they can be adjusted if needed.
* Ports are also mapped to the host for direct browser access:

  * DVWA: `http://localhost:8888/`
  * WebGoat: `http://localhost:8080/`
  * vsftpd: `ftp 127.0.0.1 2121` or `nc 127.0.0.1 2121`
