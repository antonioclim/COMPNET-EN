### Exercise

Complete the following mini-scenario:

1. Run `ping` to two different destinations: one global (e.g., `google.com`) and one local within your network (e.g., your gateway: `192.168.1.1`).
2. Run `netstat -tulnp` and identify:
   * a port in the LISTEN state,
   * a port in the ESTABLISHED state,
   * an active UDP service.
3. Use `nslookup` to:
   * query a public domain,
   * query a non-existent domain and observe the difference.

**Required evidence**  
Create a file named `S01_Part02_Output_Basic_Tools.txt` that contains:

* the command that was run,
* the full output,
* one interpretation sentence for each part.

This file will be uploaded later as proof of completion.
