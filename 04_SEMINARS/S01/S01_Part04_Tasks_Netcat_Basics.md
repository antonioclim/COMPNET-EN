### Exercise

Complete the following mini-scenario to demonstrate that you understand the TCP/UDP differences:

1. Start a TCP server on port **9100**. Connect a client and send:
   * a short message,
   * then a multi-line message.
2. Start a UDP server on port **9101**. Send two distinct messages using separate commands.
3. Compare the behaviour:
   * What happens in TCP if you keep the connection open?
   * What happens in UDP if the server is started after a message is sent?

**Required evidence**  
Create the file `S01_Part04_Output_Netcat_Activity.txt`, which must contain:

* the commands used,
* the terminal output for TCP,
* the terminal output for UDP,
* a short comparison (3–5 sentences) between the observed TCP and UDP behaviour.

This file will be uploaded later as proof of completion.
