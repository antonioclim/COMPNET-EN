### Exercise 1: Identifying Subnet Elements

For the subnet:
```

172.16.12.64/28

```

Write down:
- the network address  
- the broadcast address  
- the usable host range  
- the number of usable hosts  

---

### Exercise 2: Equal-Size Subnetting

Divide the following network into **8 equal subnets**:
```

192.168.100.0/24

```

For each subnet, write:
- the prefix  
- the network address  
- the broadcast address  

---

### Exercise 3: VLSM

You have the network:
```

10.10.0.0/24

```

Requirements:
- subnet A: at least 60 hosts  
- subnet B: at least 30 hosts  
- subnet C: at least 10 hosts  
- subnet D: point-to-point link  

Write:
- the prefix allocated to each subnet  
- the network address  
- the broadcast address  

---

### Exercise 4: Additional VLSM

Network:
```

192.168.200.0/24

```

Requirements:
- web servers: ≥ 20 hosts  
- IoT devices: ≥ 50 hosts  
- management: ≥ 5 hosts  

Write the prefixes and ranges.

### Exercise 5: Identifying Special Addresses

For each address below, state whether it is:
- a network address  
- a broadcast address  
- a usable host address  

Addresses:
- 192.168.1.0/24  
- 192.168.1.127/25  
- 10.0.5.255/23  
- 172.16.8.32/27  

---

### Exercise 6: Verification

Choose one of the subnets you calculated earlier.  
Verify it with an online calculator and include:

- the subnet  
- the calculator output
